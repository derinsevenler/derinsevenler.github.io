- title: Stigmatic imaging of dielectric nanoparticles in high refractive index object space

  description: We used a solid immersion lens to image single nanoparticles. A SIL made from Spinel allows a much higher refractive index than immersion oils, which improves both imaging resolution and the polarizability (i.e. brightness) of biological nanoparticles like viruses and exosomes.

  description: We developed a direct algorithm for measuring the thickness of biological films by imaging spectroscopy. This replaced a nonlinear iterative solver which took about 1 hour of GPU time, per megapixel. The new algorithm on a single CPU core is about 10,000x faster, allowing us to process videos of spectroscopic data in seconds.

  description: Individual viruses can be detected based on their light scattering properties when they bind to antibodies coated on a mirrorlike substrate. We built a microfluidic flow cell and perfused serum containing ebola-pseudotyped VSV virus over the substrate, and related the rate of virus binding to viral titer.

  description: Nanoparticles on a mirrorlike substrate are detectable by interferometric imaging, but the brightness of the particle is extremely sensitive to the focus position. We solved this problem by taking a stack of images while sweeping the focus position, and measuring the difference the .

- title: Quantitative interferometric reflectance imaging for the detection and measurement of biological nanoparticles
  authors: <strong>Derin Sevenler</strong>, Oguzhan Avci, and M. Selim Unlu
  year: 2017
  publication: Biomedical Optics Express
  tags: diagnostics nanotechnology photonics
  link: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b07948
  description: Individual biological nanoparticles, such as viruses and extracellular vesicles, can be detected using Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensing (IRIS). We describe a quantitative physical model and intuitive explanation for how IRIS works. This guides the optimization of the optical system for detecting bio-nanoparticles, and also how to estimate the size of the particle based on it's light scattering.

  description: We developed a new type of DNA microarray scanner which uses light scattering from nanoparticle labels rather than fluorescence, and an interferometric scanning system. This improves the sensitivity of microarrays by 3 orders of magnitude, down to the single molecule ('digital') regime.

- title: Beating the reaction limits of biosensor sensitivity with dynamic tracking of single binding events

  publication: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  tags: diagnostics nanotechnology photonics
  link: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1815329116
  description: Very low concentrations of molecular biomarkers can be measured by not just measuring the number of bound analyte molecules, but also tracking the duration of binding events. We use this approach to extend the sensitivity of single molecule biosensors beyond the so-called binding reaction limit, at which fewer than one analyte molecule is bound at equilibrium.
