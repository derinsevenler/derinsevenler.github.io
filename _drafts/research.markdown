The onging -omics revolutions in biomedical research are being driven by new technologies that allow us to measure the abundant and diverse molecules of life. Yet, large swaths of the biomolecular landscape still remain difficult to measure. Simultaneously, the 
 I'm interested in developing new tools to further push the boundaries of biosensing using tricks from nanophotonics, nonlinear fluid mechanics, and mother nature.

## Ultrasensitive molecular sensing

## Nanophotonics & Interferometry

## Ultra-throughput gene editing
