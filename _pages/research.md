The cells in our bodies use large biomolecules to store, process, and transmit information. My research program in biomedical engineering is focused on leveraging fundamental principles from the physical sciences to build new tools for 'reading' and 'writing' the molecular information encoded in these biomolecules, towards the overarching goal of improving human health and longevity. A major thrust of my current research is in developing technologies to improve the safety, efficiency, and accessibility of therapeutic gene editing. I am particularly interested in technology to enable editing large numbers of cells outside of the body, which could have signficant clinical impacts across cancer therapy, global health, regenerative medicine, autoimmune disease, and metabolic disorders.

## High throughput intracellular delivery by viscoelastic mechanoporation

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/viscoelastic_mechanoporation.gif" title="viscoelastic mechanoporation" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

Since 2016, dozens of clinical trials have been approved to study the use of CRISPR gene editing to create cell therapy products. However, the efficiency of gene editing in these trials has been very low (typically only 5%-20%) and the process for delivering the CRISPR enzyme into the cells also damages them. We recently invented a high throughput method of delivering large biomolecules such as CRISPR ribonucleoproteins into mammalian cells outside the body. As of July 2023 this approach was the fastest microfluidic delivery technology reported in the literature, and fast enough to be feasible for producing cell therapies that require hundreds of millions of engineered cells per dose. This achievement was enabled by leveraging the non-Newtonian properties of viscoelastic fluids to stretch and temporarily permeabilize the plasma membrane of cells without any contact with a solid surface or needle.

## Real-time ultrasensitive biomolecule detection

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/dynamic_detection.gif" title="dynamic detection" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

Low-abundance molecular biomarkers are a promising reservoir of diagnostic information for the early detection and precise treatment of a range of diseases. However, most ultrasensitive assay technologies remain fundamentally limited by the non-ideal binding affinity of the molecular recognition probe. In 2019, we showed that this binding 'reaction limit' could be surpassed by measuring the duration of individual molecular binding events as they happen in real time, across a surface with billions of probes. This achievement was enabled by our prior work developing a record-breaking nanoparticle imaging system that could detect individual 60 nm nanoparticles across the entire field of view of a 10x microscope objective. For the sake of comparison, this is like detecting and tracking individual 2 meter tall people across a region about five times the size of Boston, or about half the size of Los Angeles (21 km by 29 km).

<!-- Cells use biomolecules to store, transmit, and process information. 
During the start of my postdoctoral studies with Professor Mehmet Toner at MGH, I worked with a multidisciplinary team including bioengineers, clinicians, and global health experts to develop a rapid point-of-care test for a biomarker of HIV medication adherence. Over the course of two years, I led the assay development program from the antibody screening stage to immunoassay development in microwell plates, transferring the assay to a lateral flow strip format, and validating the assay with hundreds of patient samples. Along the way, I also invented a new synthetic biology approach to assaying the active form of antiretroviral medications in blood samples based on in vitro inhibition of reverse transcriptase.

My graduate research in biomedical engineering was focused on ultrasensitive molecular diagnostics and biosensing: technologies to 'read' the molecular information within a specimen or sample. As a postdoctoral research fellow I developed technologies to better deliver or 'write' new genetic and molecular information into human cells _ex vivo_.

My current long-term research goal is to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and safety of cell and gene therapies. Towards this goal, I am currently developing a very fast microfluidic transfection method for precision gene editing of mammalian cells ex vivo. A major thrust of my current research is to investigate new microfluidic devices and materials to improve the safety, accuracy, and efficiency of methods for delivering genetic material and gene editing systems into mammalian cells.
My graduate research at Boston University was focused on using nanophotonic biosensors to push the limits of ultrasensitive molecular diagnostics and single molecule detection. 

Our research program leverages fundamental principles from the physical sciences to build new tools for measuring and controlling the biomolecular information of life. 

Our approach is to fundamentally understand and then creatively apply the many unique properties of microscale and nanoscale systems to develop new technologies towards addressing emerging.

First, we perform foundational studies of underlying biophysical phenomena using theory, experiment, and numerical simulations to push the frontier of understanding. For example, have made fundamental contributions to nano-optical methods for single nanoparticle detection and molecular recognition in biosensing. Second, we apply this new knowledge in developing technologies that can address pressing biomedical challenges. We collaborate with clinical experts to take ideas all the way from conception through preliminary studies and translational development to preclinical validation.

## High throughput microfluidic intracellular delivery

New cell and gene therapies face unprecedented manufacturing challenges associated with efficient genetic modification of large numbers of cells outside of the body. We are leveraging the unique properties of viscoelastic fluids to deliver genetic material and gene editing systems into cells in a high throughput microfludic platform, towards the goal of improving the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of next-generation cell therapies.

## Microsystems for cryopreservation

Cryopreservation is the science of slowing or halting biological function at low temperatures. We are developing microscale devices and materials to control the transport of water, cryoprotective agents, and heat during cryopreservation for a range of diverse samples from cancer cells to agents of infectious disease.

## Point-of-care molecular diagnostics for antiretroviral medication adherence

Antiretroviral medications have been developed for the treatment and prevention of HIV, but in practice their efficiacy is highly dependent on patients maintaining adequate drug levels in the body. We are developing point-of-care technologies to rapidly measure medication levels and help caregivers support optimal adherence in patients.

## Ultra-sensitive molecular diagnostics

Single-molecule or 'digital' assays represent the most sensitive molecular tests available, but current methods remain limited by nonspecific binding to molecular recognition agents which are nonideal. We are developing methods which push the state-of-the-art sensitivity and performance of molecular diagnostic tests even further for applications in infectious disease and cancer.
