_"Derin was my saving grace. I stayed after class all the time to ask questions to clarify what was unclear in lecture. He is a truly gifted teacher and was passionate about simply understanding the world around him. He always knew where my questions would stem from, how to address them in an efficient manner, and where to point me to next to really lock it all in. I would've loved for him to teach more of the course if possible."_
