Since 2016, dozens of clinical trials have been approved to study the use of CRISPR gene editing to create cell therapy products. However, the efficiency of gene editing in these trials has been very low (typically only 5%-20%) and the process for delivering the CRISPR enzyme into the cells also damages them. We recently invented a high throughput method of delivering large biomolecules such as CRISPR ribonucleoproteins into mammalian cells outside the body. As of July 2023 this approach was the fastest microfluidic delivery technology reported in the literature, and fast enough to be feasible for producing cell therapies that require hundreds of millions of engineered cells per dose. This achievement was enabled by leveraging the non-Newtonian properties of viscoelastic fluids to stretch and temporarily permeabilize the plasma membrane of cells without any contact with a solid surface or needle.
