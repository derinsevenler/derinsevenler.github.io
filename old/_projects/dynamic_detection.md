Low-abundance molecular biomarkers are a promising reservoir of diagnostic information for the early detection and precise treatment of a range of diseases. However, most ultrasensitive assay technologies remain fundamentally limited by the non-ideal binding affinity of the molecular recognition probe. In 2019, we showed that this binding 'reaction limit' could be surpassed by measuring the duration of individual molecular binding events as they happen in real time, across a surface with billions of probes. This achievement was enabled by our prior work developing a record-breaking nanoparticle imaging system that could detect individual 60 nm nanoparticles across the entire field of view of a 10x microscope objective. For the sake of comparison, this is like detecting and tracking individual 2 meter tall people across a region about five times the size of Boston, or about half the size of Los Angeles (21 km by 29 km).
