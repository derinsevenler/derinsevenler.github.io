Cryopreservation is the science of slowing or halting biological function at low temperatures. We are developing a range microscale devices and materials to control the transport of water, cryoprotective agents, and heat during cryopreservation for a range of diverse samples from cancer cells to agents of infectious disease.

_Specialized microfluidic containers are allowing samples to be cooled fast enough to enable 'vitrification' or ice-free freezing of biological specimens._
